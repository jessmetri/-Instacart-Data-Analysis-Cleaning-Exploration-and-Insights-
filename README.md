Exploratory data analysis of grocery orders from Instacart, including data cleaning, visualization, and key findings."

Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place an order and have it delivered, similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash.
The dataset provided for this project is a modified version of the original one. The size of the dataset was reduced to make calculations faster, and missing values and duplicates were intentionally introduced. Special care was taken to preserve the original data distributions while applying these changes.

The analysis requires three main steps. For each step, a brief introduction should clearly explain how you plan to solve it, followed by explanatory paragraphs that justify your decisions as you progress with the solution. Finally, a conclusion should summarize your findings and choices.
